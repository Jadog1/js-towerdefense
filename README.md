js-towerdefense
===============

**Description:** The goal of this project is to create a Tower Defense game. It
is supposed to be a webapp written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game should
be as extensible as possible to make it easy to add new creeps, towers, skills,
etc.

**Questions:**

1. How do you upgrade towers (money vs. experience from kills; manually vs. automatically)?
2. How many skills/attacks should a tower have?
3. Should towers use all their skills automatically or does the player have to activate some manually?
4. Should all skills be single target or should their be AoEs?
