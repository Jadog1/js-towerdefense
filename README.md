js-towerdefense
===============

**Description:** The goal of this project is to create a Tower Defense game. It
is supposed to be a webapp written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game should
be as extensible as possible to make it easy to add new creeps, towers, skills,
etc.

**Questions:**

1. How do you upgrade towers (money vs. experience from kills; manually vs. automatically)?
